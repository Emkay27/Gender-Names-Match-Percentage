# Gender Names Match Percentage
## Check match percentage of males to females:

* Given a csv file with male and female names, get the match percentage of each and every male to every female, print all of the match percentages to a text file, here if the percentage is greater than 80%, then that's a good match of the male and female.

* The output.txt file is included.
